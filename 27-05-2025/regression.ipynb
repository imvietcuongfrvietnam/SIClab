It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognise patterns and equipped with a \"goof\" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions.[14]A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.[15]Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.[16]In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that anartificial neural networklearns to recognise 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.[17]\n",

Mitchellprovided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experienceEwith respect to some class of tasksTand performance measurePif its performance at tasks inT, as measured byP,  improves with experienceE.\"[18]This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentallyoperational definitionrather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This followsAlan Turing's proposal in his paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\".[19]\n",
            "Modern-day machine learning has two objectives.  One is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.[20]\n",

In the early days of AI as anacademic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"neural networks\"; these were mostlyperceptronsandother modelsthat were later found to be reinventions of thegeneralised linear modelsof statistics.[22]Probabilistic reasoningwas also employed, especially inautomated medical diagnosis.[23]: 488\n",

Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.[23]: 488By 1980,expert systemshad come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favour.[24]Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading toinductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, inpattern recognitionandinformation retrieval.[23]: 708–710, 755Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI andcomputer sciencearound the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"connectionism\", by researchers from other disciplines includingJohn Hopfield,David Rumelhart, andGeoffrey Hinton. Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention ofbackpropagation.[23]: 25\n",
            "Machine learning (ML), reorganised and recognised as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from thesymbolic approachesit had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics,fuzzy logic, andprobability theory.[24]\n",
            "There is a close connection between machine learning and compression. A system that predicts theposterior probabilitiesof a sequence given its entire history can be used for optimal data compression (by usingarithmetic codingon the output distribution). Conversely, an optimal compressor can be used for prediction (by finding the symbol that compresses best, given the previous history). This equivalence has been used as a justification for using data compression as a benchmark for \"general intelligence\".[25][26][27]\n",
            "An alternative view can show compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicitfeature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. For each compressor C(.) we define an associated vector space ℵ, such that C(.) maps an input string x, corresponding to the vector norm ||~x||. An exhaustive examination of the feature spaces underlying all compression algorithms is precluded by space; instead, feature vectors chooses to examine three representative lossless compression methods, LZW, LZ77, and PPM.[28]\n",
            "According toAIXItheory, a connection more directly explained inHutter Prize, the best possible compression of x is the smallest possible software that generates x. For example, in that model, a zip file's compressed size includes both the zip file and the unzipping software, since you can not unzip it without both, but there may be an even smaller combined form.\n",
            "Examples of AI-powered audio/video compression software includeNVIDIA Maxine, AIVC.[29]Examples of software that can perform AI-powered image compression includeOpenCV,TensorFlow,MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox (IPT) and High-Fidelity Generative Image Compression.[30]\n",
            "Inunsupervised machine learning,k-means clusteringcan be utilized to compress data by grouping similar data points into clusters. This technique simplifies handling extensive datasets that lack predefined labels and finds widespread use in fields such asimage compression.[31]\n",
            "Data compression aims to reduce the size of data files, enhancing storage efficiency and speeding up data transmission. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is employed to partition a dataset into a specified number of clusters, k, each represented by thecentroidof its points. This process condenses extensive datasets into a more compact set of representative points. Particularly beneficial inimageandsignal processing, k-means clustering aids in data reduction by replacing groups of data points with their centroids, thereby preserving the core information of the original data while significantly decreasing the required storage space.[32]\n",
            "Machine learning anddata miningoften employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based onknownproperties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on thediscoveryof (previously)unknownproperties in the data (this is the analysis step ofknowledge discoveryin databases). Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"unsupervised learning\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals,ECML PKDDbeing a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability toreproduce knownknowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previouslyunknownknowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.\n",
            "Machine learning also has intimate ties tooptimisation: Many learning problems are formulated as minimisation of someloss functionon a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign alabelto instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).[35]\n",

            "Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.[38]\n",

            "A core objective of a learner is to generalise from its experience.[5][43]Generalisation in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.\n",
            "The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch oftheoretical computer scienceknown ascomputational learning theoryvia theprobably approximately correct learningmodel. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. Thebias–variance decompositionis one way to quantify generalisationerror.\n",

If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject tooverfittingand generalisation will be poorer.[44]\n",

In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done inpolynomial time. There are two kinds oftime complexityresults: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.\n",

Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by anarrayor vector, sometimes called afeature vector, and the training data is represented by amatrix. Throughiterative optimisationof anobjective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.[49]An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.[18]\n",

In contrast, regression is used for tasks such as predicting a person's height based on factors like age and genetics or forecasting future temperatures based on historical data.[51]\n",

In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as aMarkov decision process(MDP). Many reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.[56]Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible.

Emotion is used as state evaluation of a self-learning agent. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[61]The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n",

The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioural environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioural environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behaviour, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62]\n",
            "Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training.[63]Classic examples includeprincipal component analysisand cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manualfeature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.\n",

Examples includeartificial neural networks,multilayer perceptrons, and superviseddictionary learning. In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabelled input data.  Examples include dictionary learning,independent component analysis,autoencoders,matrix factorisation[64]and various forms ofclustering.[65][66][67]\n",

It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.[69]\n",

However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.\n",

The method isstrongly NP-hardand difficult to solve approximately.[70]A popularheuristicmethod for sparse dictionary learning is thek-SVDalgorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied inimage de-noising. The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.[71]\n",

Anomalies are referred to asoutliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.[73]\n",

This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object.

Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.[74]\n",

Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labelled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behaviour from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.\n",

This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction.[79]Rule-based machine learning approaches includelearning classifier systems, association rule learning, andartificial immune systems.\n",

            "An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"artificial neurons\", which loosely model theneuronsin a biological brain. Each connection, like thesynapsesin a biological brain, can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is areal number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have aweightthat adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.\n",
            "The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that ahuman brainwould. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations frombiology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, includingcomputer vision,speech recognition,machine translation,social networkfiltering,playing board and video gamesandmedical diagnosis.\n",
            "Deep learningconsists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[88]\n",
            "Decision tree learning uses adecision treeas apredictive modelto go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modelling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures,leavesrepresent class labels, and branches representconjunctionsof features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typicallyreal numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions anddecision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.\n",
            "Random forest regression (RFR) falls under umbrella of decisiontree-based models. RFR is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and to avoid overfitting.  To build decision trees, RFR uses bootstrapped sampling, for instance each decision tree is trained on random data of from training set. This random selection of RFR for training enables model to reduce bias predictions and achieve accuracy. RFR generates independent decision trees, and it can work on single output data as well multiple regressor task. This makes RFR compatible to be used in various application.[89][90]\n",
            "Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of relatedsupervised learningmethods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category.[91]An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic,binary,linear classifier, although methods such asPlatt scalingexist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called thekernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
            "Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form islinear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such asordinary least squares. The latter is often extended byregularisationmethods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as inridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models includepolynomial regression(for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[92]),logistic regression(often used instatistical classification) or evenkernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of thekernel trickto implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.\n",
            "Multivariate linear regressionextends the concept of linear regression to handle multiple dependent variables simultaneously. This approach estimates the relationships between a set of input variables and several output variables by fitting amultidimensionallinear model. It is particularly useful in scenarios where outputs are interdependent or share underlying patterns, such as predicting multiple economic indicators or reconstructing images,[93]which are inherently multi-dimensional.\n",
            "A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilisticgraphical modelthat represents a set ofrandom variablesand theirconditional independencewith adirected acyclic graph(DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that performinferenceand learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, likespeech signalsorprotein sequences, are calleddynamic Bayesian networks. Generalisations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are calledinfluence diagrams.\n",
            "A Gaussian process is astochastic processin which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has amultivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-definedcovariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.\n",
            "Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.\n",

            "A genetic algorithm (GA) is asearch algorithmandheuristictechnique that mimics the process ofnatural selection, using methods such asmutationandcrossoverto generate newgenotypesin the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[95][96]Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic andevolutionary algorithms.[97]\n",
            "The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such asprobability,possibilityandimprecise probability theories. These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g.,  Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in apmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities.[98]However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance anduncertainty quantification. These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of variousensemble methodsto better handle the learner'sdecision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving.[4][9]However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.\n",
            "Rule-based machine learning (RBML) is a branch of machine learning that automatically discovers and learns 'rules' from data. It provides interpretable models, making it useful for decision-making in fields like healthcare, fraud detection, and cybersecurity. Key RBML techniques includeslearning classifier systems,[99]association rule learning,[100]artificial immune systems,[101]and other similar models. These methods extract patterns from data and evolve rules over time.\n",
            "Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representativesampleof data. Data from the training set can be as varied as acorpus of text, a collection of images,sensordata, and data collected from individual users of a service.Overfittingis something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives.Algorithmic biasis a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.\n",
            "Federated learning is an adapted form ofdistributed artificial intelligenceto training machine learning models that decentralises the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralised server. This also increases efficiency by decentralising the training process to many devices. For example,Gboarduses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back toGoogle.[102]\n",

            "In 2006, the media-services providerNetflixheld the first \"Netflix Prize\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers fromAT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built anensemble modelto win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[105]Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realised that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[106]In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[107]In 2012, co-founder ofSun Microsystems,Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[108]In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognised influences among artists.[109]In 2019Springer Naturepublished the first research book created using machine learning.[110]In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19.[111]Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behaviour of travellers.[112]Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimise smartphone's performance and thermal behaviour based on the user's interaction with the phone.[113][114][115]When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilise a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns withoutoverfitting. By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques likeOLS.[116]\n",

Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes.[118][119][120]Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.[121][122]\n",
            "Machine learning is also emerging as a promising tool in geotechnical engineering, where it is used to support tasks such as ground classification, hazard prediction, and site characterization. Recent research emphasizes a move toward data-centric methods in this field, where machine learning is not a replacement for engineering judgment, but a way to enhance it using site-specific data and patterns.[123]\n",
            "Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[124][125][126]Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[127]\n",
            "The \"black box theory\" poses another yet significant challenge. Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data.[128]The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an \"intelligence system\" that could have a \"substantial impact on an individual's life\" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided \"a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions\" it makes.[128]\n",

XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.\n",
            "Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting.

            "Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.[137]A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgements from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies.[138][139]\n",
            "Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel.[140]Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation or evasion viaadversarial machine learning.[141]\n",

In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validationmethod randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods,bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[145]\n",
